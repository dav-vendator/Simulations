# Attractor and Repeller

Attractor and Repeller basicaly is a type of **particle system**  which consist of two entites viz. **Attractor** and **Repeller**.

- ## Attractor
> Attractor attract towards each other. Let's say there are two attractors **A** and **B** at certain distance **d** from each other then if and only if distance d between them is less than some threshold they start moving towards each other. The amount of force with which they move toward each other can either be calculated by [steering formula](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732) or selected at random between [0-1] multiplied by some scalar quantity.

- ## Repeller
> Repeller repel each other. Let's say there are two repeller **A** and **B** at certain distance **d** from each otehr then if and only if distance d between them is less than some threshold they start moving away from each other. The amount of force with which they move away from each other can either be calculated by same methods.
