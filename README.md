# Simulations
This repository contains code written in multiple languages to mimic physics.

## Contains

- ### Follower 
> Follower is a simple agent which follows either a specific object or mouse movement. It is written in Processing Framework 
which is a dialect of Java programming language.

- ### KR Clock
> KR Clock is how I think the clock should be. It's draws three infinity symbols for second, minute and hour. And as value of specific parameter grows the infinity symbol grow too.

- ### Particle System 1
> A particle system is basically a system of large number of particles which interact with each other. Every particle has it's own life and slowly-slowly it drag itself to death but more particles are continuosly added to the system.

- ### p5.js
>Physics simulations using p5.js library which is a web framework for working with WEBGL and HTML5 Canvas.

- ### The Lorentz Attractor
>A creative visualization of Lorentz Attractor.
